git branch        #to view branches
git branch develop     #to create branch named develop
git switch develop      #to switch to branch develop
Create a file say "Test1 and commit changes
git push origin develop      #to see new created branch and its contents in git remote repository
In remote repository contents of develop will now show in main branch
you can create a pull request to merge contents of "develop" into the main branch

MERGING

Isolating features into different branches is a crucial practice for any serious
developer.
 At some point, a piece of code will reach a state where you'll want to
integrate it with the rest of the project. This is where the git
merge command comes in


GIT REVERT AND RESET

git revert:
The git revert command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit. 
It's a safe way to undo changes because it creates a new commit that effectively cancels out the changes introduced by a specific commit.

git revert abcdef123

git reset:
The git reset command is more powerful and can be used to reset the current branch's HEAD to a specific commit. 
Depending on the mode used {Hard or Soft}, it can either keep changes in the working directory or discard them entirely.


git diff          #to compare Working directory & Staging area

git diff commitid1 commitid2    # to compare two commits
